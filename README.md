# AssignmentsTD
Tasks Submitted as Part of the Certification fulfillment  
Assignment 1
>>Task 1 : Takes two integers from the user and performs basic mathematical calculation on them  
>>Task 2 : Takes the first and last name of user and displays a personalised greeting

Assignment 2  
>>Task 1: Takes an integer from the user and checks if the integer is a Prime Number or Not  using the modulo operator  
>>Task 2: Uses a for loop to compute the sum of digits from 1 to 50

Assignment 3  
>>Task 1: Takes integer from user and defines a function named factorial that takes the user integer, checks for negativity and then proceeds to calculate and display the factorial of that number.  
>>Task 2: Imports the math module and takes a float number from user and then uses functions from the math module to calculate Root, Log and Sine of the number and displays it.  

Assignment 4  
>>Task 1: Reading an existing sample.txt file line by line, adding a line number, and displaying "File does not exist" if the file is missing using the os module for checking.  
>>Task 2: Interacting with the user to get two separate inputs, writing the first input to output.txt in write mode (w), and then adding the second input to the file using append mode (a) and displaying the final file.

Assignment 5  
>>Task 1: The code effectively looks up a user-supplied key in a dictionary and shows the value that corresponds to it, or if the key is not found, it prints a "Student not found" message.  
>>Task 2: A list is created and then using list indexing and slicing, the first 5 elements as well as their leverse order is displayed.

Assignment 6
>>Task 1: I developed the calculator entirely using the Tkinter library for Python's graphical user interface. I defined functions to handle basic arithmetic operations, managed user input via an Entry widget, and used a Frame and the grid layout manager to arrange the digital and operator buttons in a classic calculator format, then slightly customized the colors and font for a cuter appearance by myself taking help from online resources.
